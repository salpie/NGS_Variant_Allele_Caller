README

create_vcf_and_annotate_from_novoalign.sh uses NGS files aligned using novoalign to produce a table with mutations, with annotated genes. A pileup file is first created using SAMTOOLS. Annovar is then used to produce a variant allele frequency file, which is annotated and mutations are cross-refereced to known polymorphisms using different databases. 

Ensures mutations only past if found in a minimum of 20 reads.



To submit JOB to SGE:
Submit variant allele caller to SGE as qsub command.
